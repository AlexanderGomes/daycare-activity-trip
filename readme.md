## Functionality

you have the following options to add and vote for: restaurants, stays, activities, and the actual destination (the country you're going to).

The Person who created the trip can invite people by their emails, a remainder that the user must be registered to be able to be invited to any trip

As the Admin adds destinations to all parts of the trip, travelers can participate on a live voting for their favorite ones.

The Admin can make other travelers an Admin so they can help on adding new locations to all their friends to vote for

All functions happen immediately because of socket.io, so removing an user from the trip will cause their page to refresh at the same time.
